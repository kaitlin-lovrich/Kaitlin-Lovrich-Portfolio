                                    ðŸ‘‹ Hello World! My name is Kaitlin and I am
                                    a software engineer located in Orange
                                    County, California!
                                    <br />
                                    <br /> Through hairdressing, I have spent 7+
                                    years honing my interpersonal and business
                                    management skills. I started learning to
                                    code part-time after trying a python 2
                                    course. As the course progressed and passion
                                    grew, the decision to fully commit myself to
                                    advancing my career in web development was
                                    easy. Finding the solution to complex
                                    problems for me is like solving a puzzle,
                                    it's challenging but immensely rewarding and
                                    this is what drives me. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    With my career pivot, I have had the
                                    opportunity to experience self-teaching and
                                    working with talented instructors/classmates
                                    at LearningFuze's fully immersed, agile work
                                    environment web development bootcamp.
                                    Through this program, I have engineered
                                    different apps and projects, continued
                                    practicing my problem solving skills, and
                                    gained practical working experience
                                    collaborating with developers.
